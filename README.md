# Blue Carbon in Google Earth Engine
Proposed methods and workflows in utilizing Google Earth Engine for Indonesia National Blue Carbon Inventory. This repository includes basic tutorial on using Google Earth Engine (pdf), excercise files, and the Mangrove Vegetation Index by Baloloy et al. 2020. Tutorials and some of the code comments are in Bahasa Indonesia.

List of exercise:
1. GEE interface and simple javascript
2. Exploring GEE catalogue and selecting dataset
3. Displaying an image collection
4. Displaing landsat image collections
5. Creating Landsat 8 Raw and TOA Reflectance cloud free mosaic composite
6. Calculating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
7. Creating Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance cloud free mosaic composite
8. Land/Water masking

Some of the tutorial content were taken form Google Earth Engine Workshop 2019 Hands on Sessions by the Google Earth Outreach team. Make sure to cite all of the authors properly when using these scripts.
